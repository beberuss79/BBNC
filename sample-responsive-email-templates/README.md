The NetCommunity 7.1 SP1 release (released in July, 2017) included updates to the HTML editor used for creating email messages and email templates from within NetCommunity. One of the most important benefits of this upgrade is that the editor now includes access to the HTML <head> tag that's necessary for creating responsive design. With responsive design, your emails display optimally on any device — desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Our fantastic web designers in Blackbaud Professional Services have created three sample Email Templates that you can easily load into NetCommunity and use as a foundation for creating beautiful, modern, responsive email messages that take advantage of the head tag access. You can find them attached to this post. Detailed instructions on how to load these into NetCommunity <a href="https://kb.blackbaud.com/articles/Article/110942/">can be found here</a>.

These templates include:
 - Sample Appeal Template
 - Sample Newsletter Template
 - Sample Acknowledgement Template

Things you will need to change in the templates:

<b>Colors:</b> “Out of the box” these templates are using the Blackbaud green color scheme. This will need to be changed to match your organization’s branding and color palette. The hexadecimal value to look for and replace in the template is “8cbe4f”.

<b>Fonts:</b> The templates are using Open Sans and Merriweather fonts from the Google Fonts service. This will need to be changed to match your organization’s branding and typeface(s) or replaced with a web-standard font stack. These are easy to global find/replace.

<b>Images:</b> There are a number of images in the sample templates that will need to be changed. All images in the sample template are being loaded from a third-party service, so they will be easy to find in the html source code. Search for “placehold.it” and replace them with images you have uploaded to your site’s image gallery. These images are meant to demonstrate the appropriate size and usage for each respective area of the template.

<b>Image ALT tags:</b> There are two significant alt tags that need to be replaced. One is the banner image. The template is using the "Blackbaud Foundation" alt tag and the Primary content banner image is using a placeholder alt tag. These should be replaced with relevant organization information.

<b>Links:</b> The links at the bottom (color band 3 links for home, privacy policy and email preferences) as well as the area in the footer that includes the email address info and privacy/preferences will need to be updated with the appropriate links on your web site.

<b>Footer:</b> Your organization's contact information should be added to the footer.
